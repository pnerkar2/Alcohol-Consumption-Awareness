# Alcohol-Consumption-Awareness
Analysis to highlight the magnitude of alcohol consumption worldwide and take a defined direction to focus on the causes and effects of alcohol consumption in the United States.
The questions we will be focusing on are as follows,

● Is alcohol a major problem in the United States as of 2019?
● Is unemployment causing increased alcohol consumption in the United States as of 2019?
● Are road accidents a major effect of increased alcohol consumption?
 
Once we can answer these questions, we can create a sense of awareness among individuals. Generally, people who are victims to substance abuse live in denial and don’t address it as a problem. By highlighting the causes which can lead to increased alcohol consumption and later defining the effects, we can help these people realize this problem and encourage
them to act positively towards it
